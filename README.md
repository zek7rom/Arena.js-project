# Arena.js-project
This project will be on the creation of arena.js. Arena.js is basically game where the user chooses a pokemon once the user has chosen his/she pokemon they will be put in the arena where they will fight different pokemon, if they win there pokemon will get an amount of exp depending on the exp.

Hey I'm a new programmer, I've been practicing javascript I'm still pretty new to it, but man oh man its really fun.
I love sports and anime.
